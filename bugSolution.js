The solution often involves meticulously reviewing the native module's integration with Expo.  Common causes include:

1. **Incorrect Native Module Setup:** Verify that the native module is correctly configured for both Android and iOS. Ensure all necessary files are included, and the module's interface is correctly exposed to the JavaScript layer.
2. **Expo Compatibility:** Check for any known compatibility issues between the native module's dependencies and Expo's environment.  Older or incompatible dependencies might clash.
3. **Linking Issues:** Ensure proper linking of the native module to the React Native project. Follow Expo's guidelines for adding native modules, paying close attention to the build process for both platforms. 
4. **Permissions:** Ensure that the native module has all the necessary permissions for the operation it performs. 
5. **Debugging Native Code:** Use platform-specific debugging tools (Android Studio, Xcode) to investigate errors within the native module's code directly. This might provide more detailed error messages than what's visible in Expo Go.

`bugSolution.js` provides a revised implementation with the necessary steps to address these potential problems. Remember to rebuild and restart the Expo Go app after making any changes.
